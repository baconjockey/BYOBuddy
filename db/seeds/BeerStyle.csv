Belgian pilsners are sweeter than the sharp bitterness of their Bavarian counterparts.  Smooth, light-bodied, and mildly malted, Belgian pilsners have a floral aroma pair well with fish and shellfish.

Belgian white beers are even more refreshing than its Bavarian counterpart, and are often spiced with orange peel and coriander.  Highly carbonated, flavorful, and low in bitterness, they are very versatile beers that pair well with almost everything.  They specifically shine with lighter fare: seafood (especially when prepared with citrus flavors) and sweet meats.

Aged in casks, they lack hop bitterness but are very acidic and tend to have a characteristic musty, tart taste.  Lambics of different ages - and therefore, different levels of mellowness - are blended together to create gueuze.","Belle-Vue (5.2%), Cantillon (5.5%), De Troch (5.5%), Girardin (5%), Mort Subite (4%)",lambicFruit Beer,,Belgium,"Fruit beers are the product of fermenting lambic beers with fruit.

Their yeast strains contiribute a light fruitiness - with notes such as licorice, orange peel, and cinammon - that make them pair well with earthy, nutty, and herb-filled foods. Moderate hops, in both taste and aroma, make Belgian pale ales very drinkable.  Belgian pale ales do not pair well with acidic foods or those with citric flair.","Artevelde (5.7%), De Koninck (5%), De Koninck Cuvee (7.7%), Speciale Op-ale (5%), Straffe Hendrik (6%), Vieux Temps (5.5%)",belgian_pale_aleGolden Ale,,Belgium,"Golden ales look deceptively innocuous - despite their delicate color, they are ABV heavyweights and often come in at 8% and above.  Light-bodied and delicate with a perfumey nose, it rolls smooth and dry on the tongue, finishes with a crack of hops, and leaves a warm, spicy aftertaste.","Delerium Tremens (9%), Duvel (8.5%), Lucifer (8%), Piraat (10.5%), Sloeber (7.5%)",golden_aleFlemish Brown Ale,"Oud Bruin, old brown ale",Belgium,"Flemish brown ales are brightly acidic - much like their red ale counterparts - but have darker raisin, chocolate, and toffee notes due to their roasted malts.  Flemish brown ales pair well with fatty meats and are intensified by dishes with raisins and prunes.

Flemish red ales also pair well with crab, oysters, moules frites, squid, octopus, ceviche, smoked salmon, and most fish, especially if prepared with citrus or vinegar.  Their lightness also makes them a good brunch beer, as their acidity and underlying sweetness work well with omelettes.","Bacchus (4.5%), Rodenbach Grand Cru (6.5%)",flemish_red_aleSaison,,Belgium,"Traditionally a farmhouse ale, saisons were originally brewed in cold weather and drunk during the warm summer months.  Thirst-quenching, light, and brisk, saisons are mostly brewed from pale malts and flavored with wide variety of spices.  Saisons are incredibly versatile with food and pair with almost everything.  They do not, however, pair well with delicate fish, desserts, or acidic tomato sauces.","Belgo Blonde (5.5%), Dupont (6.5%), Pipaix (6.5%), Saison Silly (5%)",saisonTrappist Dubbel,"Trappiste beer, double",Belgium,"Trappist beers were originally brewed by monks in the interest of self-sufficiency: monks brewed beer for themselves as well as for sale.

Although sunny, golden tripels are lighter than dubbels, they weigh in at a higher alcohol by volume: they often come in at around 9%.  Tripels are light, hoppy, herbal, and fruity.

However, they are brewed by non Trappist monasteries or commercial breweries that have adopted the name of a defunct, fictitious, or nonbrewing abbey.
